Big Roller

Big Roller is a random number generator application intend for delivery on NXP 
LCP2119 ARM MCU. The application aims to provide an alternative to dice rolling
in table top wargames and roleplaying games. 
The system is implemented using the Riscy Pygness created by Frank Sergeant 
(http://pygmy.utoh.org/riscy/index.html). Most of the application software was 
written in high level Forth though a number of low level words were also added. 
Minor changes/additions were made to the build files to allow for successful 
delivery on LPC2119.

Unfortunately some of the changes I have made lack wider documentation, it was 
never really meant for the 'wild'.

LICENSE - I have included the Riscy Pygness License, see relevant documents.

System Components:
NXP LPC2119 stamp board
4x20 Character LCD display with KS0066U driver
12 button keypad
Various resistors, capacitors and bits of wire; stuff every self respecting 
embedded systems hobbyist should have lying around in abundance.

DISCLAIMER - I accept no responsibility for any damages or lose incurred from
the download and/or use of this software.
